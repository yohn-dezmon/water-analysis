# ATTAINS Water Quality Assessment GIS Dataset

OGC GeoPackage:
- designed to support storage and exchange of geospatial data, including vector features, raster images, and tiles, in a single SQLite database file.

This dataset provides information about the conditions of the nationâ€™s surface waters.  States, territories and authorized tribes (states for brevity) assess the quality of their surface waters and report it to EPA as part of their Integrated Report, which combines Clean Water Act Sections 303(d) and 305(b).  This dataset provides the spatial locations of state-defined Assessment Units and Assessment decisions for those waters.  Designated Use and assessed Parameter information have been rolled up into groups.  This dataset also includes attributes indicating the Assessment Units that have one or more Actions (a.k.a., Plans, such as Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL), Alternative Restoration Plans, Protection Plans, etc.) associated with the water.   For more information, please see https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/attains.

This dataset provides the latest information submitted to EPA for each state.  States typically provide this data to EPA every two years, but the currency of the data may vary by state.  The Control table indicates the latest data available for each state.

This dataset replaces the separate Pre-2015 geospatial datasets for CWA Section 303(d), 305(b), and TMDLs.
